/**
This class extends the JUCE Colour class by adding support for the CIE LCH perceptual colour space. 
The CIE LCH colour space is a colour space, which reflects how humans perceive colours. 
Therefore interpolating colours in CIE LCH gives smoother variations than when using HSV/HSL. 
LCH is an abbreviation for Lightness, Chroma(Saturation) and Hue.
Note that the LCH colour space contains more colours than humans can see.
Therefore it is possible, that a LCH colour cannot be converted to an exact RGB colour.
In such a case, the closest RGB approximation is used. 

Internally The CIE LCH colour space uses the CIE Lab and the CIE XYZ colour spaces. So you find functions for 
those as well. But not that many, because the focus is on CIE LCH.

See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space.

Here an example on how to use the class:
@code
CIELCHColour colour = Colours::yellow;
float l, c, h;
colour.getCIELCH(l, c, h);
float newSaturation = c / 2.0f;
bool imaginary;
CIELCHColour newColour = CIELCHColour::fromCIELCH(l, newSaturation, h, colour.getAlpha(), imaginary);
if (imaginary)
   std::cout << "Imaginary colour. RGB values have been clipped to the visible range";
@endcode

Because the CIELCHColour class is subclassing the JUCE::Colour class, it has all its functionality. 
It is e.g. perfectly OK to write:
@code
CIELCHColour newColour  = CIELCHColour::fromHSV(h, s,  v);
CIELCHColour newColour2 = Colours::yellow;
@endcode
